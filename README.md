Quick hack to start VM of many Azure Subscription and Resource groups via script in certain order (define by tags)


I use in AZ automation account runbook with schedule to start every morning.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
